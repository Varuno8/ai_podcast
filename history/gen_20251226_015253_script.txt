Host 1: Alright, we’re back. So, remember Kuldeep Singh Sengar? Yeah, the guy from the Unnao case who apparently thinks jail is just a temporary vibe? Well, the Supreme Court just got a spicy little gift because someone finally realized his sentence suspension is a total L move. [Sighs] Host 2: YOOOO! No way! This man really tried to hit 'pause' on a life sentence like it’s a Netflix show he’s tired of? [Laughs] That's wild, man! That’s like trying to pause a heart attack just to finish your double cheeseburger! Host 1: Seriously. The High Court basically gave him main character energy and let him walk out, but now these lawyers—Anjale Patel and Pooja Shilpkar—are like, 'Umm, excuse me, logic has literally left the chat?' They’re appealing because the court apparently ignored his 'serious criminal history.' Like, hello? Maybe check his resume before you give him a 'get out of jail free' card? Host 2: [Laughs] Bro, 'ignored his history'?! That’s like a zookeeper letting a tiger out of the cage because he promised he’s a vegan now! 'Oh, don't worry, he’s just going for a quick walk to the Supreme Court!' I’m actually dying, man! Host 1: It’s so sus. Like, the legal system is out here playing 'Choose Your Own Adventure' but only for the villains. But now it’s in the big leagues. Let’s see if the Supreme Court can actually find a clue or if they’re still searching for the 'on' switch for their common sense. Host 2: LET'S GO! Supreme Court better bring that smoke! Don’t let him do the side-quest, keep him in the main campaign! This legal system is a whole circus and I’m just here for the clown show! [Laughs]
