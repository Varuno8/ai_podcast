Host 1: Yo, welcome back. Today we're talking about Pakistan, who apparently decided their biggest export wasn't textiles or cricket stars, but... professional beggars. [Laughs] They literally just dropped the news that they stopped 51,000 people from leaving the country because they looked too 'sus' on the beggar scale. 
Host 2: 51,000?! That's not a travel restriction, that's a whole-ass music festival lineup of people just trying to get that bag—literally! [Laughs] It’s like the government is playing a giant game of 'Guess Who' but the only losing card is a cardboard sign! 
Host 1: No, it’s worse. They’re using AI for this! Imagine getting to the airport and a computer algorithm hits you with the 'Main Character Energy' check and says, 'Nah fam, you look like you’re gonna be asking for spare change in Dubai, sit your 100-percent-unemployed-butt down.' It’s a total L move for the travelers. 
Host 2: [Umm] AI for begging?! That’s like bringing a laser-guided missile to a thumb-wrestling match at a circus! Are they scanning for specifically sad-looking eyes or the perfect 'I lost my wallet' pitch? I’m losing it! 
Host 1: [Sighs] Saudi Arabia and the UAE were basically like, 'Please stop sending your pro-level panhandlers, we’re full.' So now Pakistan is bragging that their passport ranking went up because they’re gatekeeping their own citizens. It’s giving 'security guard at a VIP club' but the club is just... leaving. 
Host 2: Energy level 100! They really said 'Stop the grind!' If your AI thinks I'm a beggar, I'm not mad, I'm just impressed the robot thinks I have the hustle! [Laughs] Next up, AI to stop people from wearing Crocs in public, please!
